# Mechanize [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gushonorato/mechanize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gushonorato/mechanize) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/gushonorato/mechanize/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/gushonorato/mechanize?branch=master)

Build web scrapers and automate interaction with websites in Elixir with ease! One of Mechanize's main design goals is to enable developers to easily create concurrent web scrapers without imposing any process architecture. Mechanize is heavily inspired on [Ruby](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize) version of [Mechanize](https://metacpan.org/release/WWW-Mechanize). It features:

- Follow hyperlinks
- Scrape data easily using CSS selectors
- Populate and submit forms (WIP)
- Follow and tracks 3xx redirects
- Follow meta-refresh
- Automatically stores and sends cookies (TODO)
- File upload (TODO)
- Track of the sites that you have visited as a history (TODO)
- Proxy support (TODO)
- Obey robots.txt (TODO)
